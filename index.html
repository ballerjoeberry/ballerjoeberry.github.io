<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bucks</h2>
<p>The Bucks have been going off lately. They are on a 13 game win streak with Giannis Antetokounmpo carrying the weight. If the Bucks keep this up, they will go on to have a great season.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rookie of the Year?</h2>
<p>Ja Morant's explosive NBA skill set pushed him to the front of Rookie of the Year talk over the first two months of the season, but a recent injury flare-up will keep him out for at least a week or two. With this injury, some players are inching closer to Morant. Kendrick Nunn is averaging 16.4 ppg for the Heat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Carmelo Anthony's Return</h2>
<p>Carmelo Anthony has recently been given another chance in the NBA, and he is playing for the Trail Blazers. He is averaging 16.9 ppg and is doing very well for being gone so long. Carmelo is a veteran when it comes to the NBA, and I believe he will be a great addition for the Trail Blazers in the upcoming season.&nbsp;</p>
